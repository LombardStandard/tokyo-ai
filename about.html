                We started building out the TAI community on November 2nd, 2023, 
                through Tokyo AI Talks (TAIT), an invite-only community that met 
                every two months over three hours for a series of lightning talks 
                and panels, with the objective of connecting the brightest engineers,
                scientists, entrepreneurs, and investors interested in knowledge 
                sharing, serendipity, and engineering excellence. Among the speakers,
                we had CTOs of Tokyo-based startups, researchers from top universities,
                software architects from established tech companies, and other profiles
